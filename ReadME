👨‍💻 SageMaker Employee Attrition Prediction Pipeline 🚀
This repository implements an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow on Amazon SageMaker to predict employee attrition (LeaveOrNot). The pipeline covers data loading from S3, feature engineering, model training using Logistic Regression, evaluation, and finally, model serialization and deployment simulation by uploading the artifact back to S3.

🌟 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to successfully build, train, and validate a predictive model for employee attrition using raw data sourced from Amazon S3. The solution demonstrates key integration points between Python/Scikit-learn and AWS services like S3 and IAM (via execution role) within an Amazon SageMaker environment.

Key Technologies Used

Cloud/ML Platform: Amazon SageMaker, AWS S3

Data Manipulation: Pandas

Modeling: Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, StandardScaler, ColumnTransformer)

Serialization: Joblib

Interaction: Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)

💾 Dataset & Task Summary
The workflow processes an employee dataset loaded from S3. The target variable is LeaveOrNot.

Initial Data Status

Metric	Value	Notes
Initial Shape	(4653, 9)	Before any cleaning.
Duplicate Records	1889	A significant number of duplicates were identified.
Cleaned Shape	(2764, 9)	Shape after dropping identified duplicates.
S3 Bucket Name	employeedataset12	Used for data sourcing and model artifact storage.
Workflow Execution Summary

The notebook successfully completed all defined tasks:

AWS Setup: Established Boto3 session and retrieved the IAM Execution Role ARN.

Data Ingestion: Downloaded Employee.csv from S3 to the local environment.

Analysis & Visualization: Generated visualizations for Gender Distribution (Pie Chart) and Education Levels (Count Plot).

Feature Engineering:

Split data into X (Features) and Y (Target: LeaveOrNot).

Applied ColumnTransformer to perform One-Hot Encoding on categorical features and Pass-Through on numerical features, resulting in a 14-feature array.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Data split 80/20 (test_size=0.2, random_state=0).

Features were scaled using StandardScaler.

Trained a LogisticRegression model.

Evaluation Metrics on Test Set (931 records):

Accuracy: 0.7240

Precision: 0.6329

Recall: 0.4199

F1 Score: 0.5048

A Confusion Matrix Heatmap was generated for visual inspection.

Model Deployment Simulation (Serialization):

The trained model (logreg.pkl) was serialized using joblib.

The artifact was uploaded to S3: s3://employeedataset12/models/logreg_model.pkl.

Verification: The model was successfully downloaded from S3, loaded, and re-ran against the test set, yielding identical evaluation metrics, confirming integrity.

⚙️ Setup & Execution (For Running the Notebook)
This workflow is intended to be run within an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance or Studio Environment that has the necessary IAM role attached with S3 read/write permissions for the specified bucket.

Prerequisites

An active AWS Account.

An IAM Role with permissions for:

Amazon S3 read/write access to the bucket employeedataset12.

Permissions to retrieve caller identity (sts:GetCallerIdentity).

A SageMaker Execution Role ARN available to the environment.

Environment Libraries (Installation required if not in a standard SageMaker image)

Bash
pip install sagemaker pandas boto3 scikit-learn seaborn joblib
