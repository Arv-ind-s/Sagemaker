# 👨‍💻 SageMaker Employee Attrition Prediction Pipeline 🚀

This repository implements an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow on **Amazon SageMaker** to predict employee attrition (LeaveOrNot). The pipeline covers data loading from S3, feature engineering, model training using **Logistic Regression**, evaluation, and finally, model serialization and deployment simulation by uploading the artifact back to S3.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to successfully build, train, and validate a predictive model for employee attrition using raw data sourced from Amazon S3. The solution demonstrates key integration points between Python/Scikit-learn and AWS services like **S3** and **IAM (via execution role)** within an Amazon SageMaker environment.

### Key Technologies Used

* **Cloud/ML Platform:** Amazon SageMaker, AWS S3
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
* **Modeling:** Scikit-learn (`LogisticRegression`, `StandardScaler`, `ColumnTransformer`)
* **Serialization:** Joblib
* **Interaction:** Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)

## 📊 Workflow Execution Summary

The project follows a standard ML lifecycle, with steps executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### 1. Data Ingestion & Setup (Task 1 & 2)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S3 Bucket Name | `employeedataset12` | Used for data sourcing and model artifact storage. |
| IAM Role | `arn:aws:sts::637423581679:assumed-role/sage-s3full/SageMaker` | Execution role retrieved for S3 access. |
| Initial Data Shape | (4653, 9) | Records loaded from S3 (`Employee.csv`). |
| Duplicate Records | 1889 | Identified but not explicitly removed in the provided script. |

### 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing (Task 4)

The data was prepared for modeling using Scikit-learn's preprocessing tools.

| Step | Technique | Columns Applied | Output Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Categorical Encoding | `OneHotEncoder` | `Education`, `City`, `Gender`, `EverBenched` | 10 |
| Numerical Pass-Through | `passthrough` | `JoiningYear`, `PaymentTier`, `Age`, `ExperienceInCurrentDomain` | 4 |
| Total Features | - | - | **14** |

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation (Task 5)

A Logistic Regression model was trained on the transformed and scaled features.

| Metric | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | `LogisticRegression` (`random_state=0`) | Used Scaled Features (`StandardScaler`) |
| **Accuracy** | **`0.7240`** | Overall correct prediction rate. |
| **Precision** | **`0.6329`** | Of all "Left" predictions, the percentage that actually left. |
| **Recall** | **`0.4199`** | Of all employees who left, the percentage correctly identified. |
| **F1 Score** | **`0.5048`** | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. |
